A few eras ago I worked a lot with php and this is just the repo to publish that project. Not a bit thing but I remember how happy I was to find out that this project was ranked absolute first for almost 2 weeks on [phpclasses](https://www.phpclasses.org/)

## Run the doc page
Simply copy the content of the repo into a `ucaptcha` (or whatever name u like)folder in the apache webroot (or whatever web server), then navigate to http://localhost/ucaptcha.  
Obviously you can as well create a virtual host and then serve it through a well named local domain.

## Need help?
I feel quite rusty since in the end I touched it last time in 2011, but I'll do my best to help you.
